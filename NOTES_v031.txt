- updated for monkey v66
- re-arranged preloading/buffer loading (future-proofing)
- uses #MINIB3D_DEBUG_MODEL = "true" to debug models instead of hardcoding

- with monkey V66, you can only load new shaders in OnCreate() or OnRender() [android]
- with monkey V66, SetRender() must be in OnCreate()
- in monkey v66, shaders must be setup in OnCreate(). (ie. fastbrightshader = New FastBrightShader)
